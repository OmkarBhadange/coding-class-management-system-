Coding Class Management System
Description:
The Coding Class Management System project is designed to streamline the management of coding classes, including scheduling, student enrollment, and class information storage.

Key Features:
Frontend and Backend in Python: Both the frontend and backend of the system are implemented using Python programming language, allowing for seamless integration and easy maintenance.

SQLite Database: The system utilizes the SQLite library for database management. All class information, including schedules, student details, and class materials, is stored in an SQLite database.

DB Browser Interface: The system includes a user-friendly interface built with the DB Browser tool, which allows administrators to view, manage, and update class information directly in the database.

Class Scheduling: Administrators can schedule coding classes, specifying details such as class name, instructor, date, time, and duration. This feature helps in organizing and planning class sessions efficiently.

Student Enrollment: Students can enroll in coding classes through the system. They provide their details, such as name, age, and contact information, and are assigned to their respective classes.

Class Information Management: The system enables administrators to manage all aspects of class information, including adding new classes, updating existing ones, and deleting outdated information. This ensures that class details are always accurate and up to date.

Conclusion:
The Coding Class Management System project simplifies the process of managing coding classes by providing a user-friendly interface and efficient backend functionality.
By utilizing Python programming language and SQLite database, the system offers a reliable and flexible solution for scheduling classes, enrolling students, and maintaining class information.
Whether you're an administrator or a student, this system helps streamline the management of coding education, making it easier for everyone involved.
